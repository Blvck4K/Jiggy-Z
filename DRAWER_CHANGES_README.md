# Side Drawer Navigation Implementation

This update adds a side drawer navigation to the Jiggy-Z application, replacing the navigation links in the header with a hamburger menu that opens a drawer with expanded navigation options.

## Features Added

### 1. Side Drawer Navigation
- Created a new drawer component that slides in from the right side
- Added a hamburger menu icon to the header that opens the drawer
- Moved navigation links (Home, Search, Movies, TV Shows) from the header to the drawer
- Added a "Games" link to the navigation options

### 2. Create Content Section
- Added a "Create" section to the drawer that is only visible to authenticated users
- Implemented options to create new Movies, TV Shows, and Games
- Created a unified CreateContentPage component that adapts based on the content type
- Protected all create routes with authentication checks

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Implemented smooth animations for opening and closing the drawer
- Added a backdrop overlay that closes the drawer when clicked
- Included icons for better visual hierarchy in the navigation
- Improved mobile responsiveness

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `src/components/Drawer.tsx`: The main drawer component with navigation links and create options
- `src/pages/create/CreateContentPage.tsx`: A unified page for creating different types of content

### Modified Files
- `src/components/Header.tsx`: Removed navigation links and added hamburger menu
- `src/App.tsx`: Added new routes for create functionality

## How It Works

1. **Navigation Flow**:
   - User clicks the hamburger menu icon in the header
   - The drawer slides in from the right with navigation options
   - Clicking a navigation link takes the user to that page and closes the drawer
   - Clicking outside the drawer or the X button closes it

2. **Create Content Flow**:
   - The "Create" section is only visible to authenticated users
   - Clicking a create option navigates to the appropriate create page
   - If a user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the login page
   - After login, they are redirected back to the create page they were trying to access

3. **Authentication Integration**:
   - The drawer checks the authentication state to determine whether to show the Create section
   - Create pages are protected by the AuthGuard component
   - User information is displayed at the bottom of the drawer when logged in

## Technical Implementation

- Used React's useState for managing the drawer's open/close state
- Implemented smooth transitions using Tailwind CSS classes
- Used Lucide React icons for consistent visual styling
- Leveraged React Router for navigation
- Integrated with the existing AuthContext for authentication checks
