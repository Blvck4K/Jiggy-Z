# Jiggy-Z Authentication and Section Pages

This update adds dedicated section pages for Movies, TV Shows, and Games, with authentication protection to ensure only logged-in users can access these pages.

## Features Added

### 1. Section Pages
- Created dedicated pages for Movies, TV Shows, and Games sections
- Each page displays a grid of content items specific to that section
- Added "Back to Home" navigation for easy return to the main page

### 2. Authentication Protection
- Added AuthGuard component to protect routes that require authentication
- Implemented automatic redirection to login page for unauthenticated users
- Added state preservation to return users to their intended destination after login

### 3. Enhanced Navigation
- Updated "Show More" buttons to link to the appropriate section pages
- Implemented conditional navigation based on authentication status
- Preserved the intended destination when redirecting to login

### 4. Login/Signup Flow Improvements
- Updated login and signup pages to handle redirects after successful authentication
- Added state management to remember the page the user was trying to access

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `src/pages/MoviesPage.tsx`: Dedicated page for movie content
- `src/pages/TVShowsPage.tsx`: Dedicated page for TV show content
- `src/pages/GamesPage.tsx`: Dedicated page for game content
- `src/components/AuthGuard.tsx`: Component to protect routes requiring authentication

### Modified Files
- `src/App.tsx`: Added new routes and implemented AuthGuard
- `src/components/ContentSections.tsx`: Updated "Show More" buttons to link to section pages
- `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`: Added redirect handling after login
- `src/pages/SignupPage.tsx`: Added redirect handling after signup
- `src/pages/ContentDetailPage.tsx`: Updated to work with the new structure

## How It Works

1. When a user clicks "Show More" on the homepage:
   - If authenticated: They are taken directly to the section page
   - If not authenticated: They are redirected to the login page

2. After successful login/signup:
   - The user is automatically redirected to the page they were trying to access
   - This creates a seamless experience while maintaining security

3. Protected routes:
   - All section pages (`/movies`, `/tvshows`, `/games`) are protected by the AuthGuard
   - The AuthGuard checks if the user is authenticated before rendering the page
   - If not authenticated, it redirects to the login page with the return URL

## Testing

To test this functionality:
1. Log out of the application
2. Click on any "Show More" button on the homepage
3. You should be redirected to the login page
4. After logging in, you should be automatically redirected to the section page you tried to access
5. Try accessing `/movies`, `/tvshows`, or `/games` directly via URL - you should be redirected to login if not authenticated
